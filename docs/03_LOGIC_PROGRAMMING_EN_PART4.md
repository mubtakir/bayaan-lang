This part summarizes probabilistic reasoning and links to the causal network engine guide.

## 14) Probabilistic Reasoning (Concepts)
- Reason with uncertainty using values in [0..1].
- Combine logic with fuzzy/continuous states to model real-world interactions.

## 15) Causal Network Engine (Reference)
- See: bayan/docs/CAUSAL_NETWORK_ENGINE_GUIDE.md
- Learn how to define nodes, edges (causal relations), and perform inference on the network.
