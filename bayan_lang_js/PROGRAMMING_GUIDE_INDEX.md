## 💡 Example: All Paradigms Together

```javascript
// Procedural
var students = ["Ahmed", "Sara", "Ali"];

// Object-Oriented
class Student {
    constructor(name, major) {
        this.name = name;
        this.major = major;
    }
}

// Logic Programming
fact student("Ahmed", "CS");
fact student("Sara", "Math");
rule smart(?x) :- student(?x, "CS");

// Causal Programming
cause study causes success {
    probability: 0.8,
    time: "medium_term",
    impact: "individual"
}

// All working together!
var ahmed = new Student("Ahmed", "CS");
query smart(?who);  // Result: Ahmed
var path = find_strongest_path("study", "success");
console.log(path.toString());
```
